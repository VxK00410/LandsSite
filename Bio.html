    <h1> <em>Lands are a band</em></h1>

<p> Formed at the tail end of 2023, Lands are 5 goofy blokes operating out of Stockport.
</br></br>
Starting as a 3-piece of old school friends, the band expanded from a Christmas catchup to a more consistent project.</br>
Adding an experimental musician and then a lyricist/vocalist in 2024, the chaps started to find a more coherent sound.
</br></br>
Blending the sounds of stoner rock, psychadelia, folk and funk into something that makes an entertaining racket, Lands are heading into the new year with recording and live performances on the horizon.
